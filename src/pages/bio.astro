        <strong>Dieter Rams</strong> (born in Wiesbaden, Germany, 1932) is a legendary industrial designer whose ideas and products have shaped the way we think about design today. Best known for his work at <strong>Braun</strong> and <strong>Vitsœ</strong>, Rams created some of the most iconic products of the 20th century — simple, functional, and beautifully minimal.

        At Braun, where he started in the 1950s and later became Head of Design, he helped define a timeless aesthetic that still feels modern today. Think clean lines, logical layouts, and a focus on what really matters. With Vitsœ, he designed the <strong>606 Universal Shelving System</strong>, a perfect example of his belief in long-lasting and adaptable design.
      </p>

        Rams also wrote down his design philosophy in what became the <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dieter-Rams-Principles-Good-Design/dp/3791387324" target="_blank">Ten Principles for Good Design</a></strong>. His main message? Good design is useful, honest, and as little design as possible. No extra fluff, no fake features — just things that work well and look good because of it.
      </p>

        His influence can be seen everywhere, especially in the work of Apple’s design team. If you’ve ever thought an iPhone felt “just right,” there’s a good chance Dieter Rams had something to do with it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond his designs, Rams has been vocal about the role of designers in a world full of overconsumption. He pushed for more sustainable, thoughtful design long before it became a trend. His life and legacy were captured in the 2018 documentary Rams by Gary Hustwit.
